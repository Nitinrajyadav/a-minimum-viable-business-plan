How a viable business plan might look like?

### Summary:

Dummy-D offers the most relaxed space traveling experience around the globe. Our SpaceCrafts are developed to make travelers feel like home providing one of a kind features such as internet, sofas on-board and Jacuzzi. We've been working on our product for a year now using own capital and currently searching 40.000.000 drachmas to make the business roll. We have already got some customer attention manifested via pre-booked tickets; however, success is calculated on full deposited bookings, starting from 1st January 2050.

#### a. Geotargeting

More than half of space travelers are Africans with ~50% being Malawians. According to the African Space Institution, the mean African citizen spends more than 100k drachmas per year for traveling with more than 50% of this amount going to space traveling. Later on, Latin American and Chinese markets will be also targeted.

| Laika           |    3    |    5     |    5    |   13    |

Dummy-D outperforms competitive players being far more comfort; however, absolute ticket price is higher than the market average price as relaxation costs. Overall, we entry the market offering an equivalent to traditional market leaders product.
